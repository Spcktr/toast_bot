## Toast Discord Bot

Simple discord bot written for a gaming discord.

## Prerequisites

You'll need nodejs and npm installed as it uses the latest disord.js for api connections.

## Configuration

Initial configuration:
Copy the `example_config.json` and rename it to `config.json`
Then set it up with your secret key off the discord site.

To set your server list:
Copy the `example_server_list.json` file and rename it to `server_list.json`.
Change the examples to suit your own game server information, you can add or remove the number of the servers listed by adding more "name": and "value": fields.

## Running

Within the base folder, run `node mybot.js` and wait for it to join your server.
